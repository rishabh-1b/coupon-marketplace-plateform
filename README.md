# üè∑Ô∏è Coupon Marketplace Platform
A Coupon Marketplace Platform build with mongodb, express, reactjs and nodejs.

# üí°About this project 
A full-featured web application that allows users to **buy and sell coupons** securely. This platform serves as a digital marketplace where users can list unused coupons, discover deals, and trade coupons in a seamless, user-friendly environment.

Users can:
- Sign up with OTP verification
- Log in and view all available coupons
- Post their own coupons for sale
- Browse and buy listed coupons
- Cancel or manage their transactions

I built this project to deepen my skills in full-stack development and real-time user flows like OTP authentication.
